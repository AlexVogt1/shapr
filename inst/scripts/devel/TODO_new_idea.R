### TODO:

# 1. create a function which lists which features that should be computed for each test obs:
# 2. Map out an S matrix taking the values 1, 0 and -1, where -1 means excluded, and 1 and 0 as before
# 3. Then loop through the create_ctree function to build the different ctrees, and save them,
# or we can also do the sampling of the observations for each of the test observations that need them
# What version we use depends on how large the different objects are
# 4. In the end, do prediction with a modified function for each testObservations
# Then compute the Shapley values with KernelSHAP
