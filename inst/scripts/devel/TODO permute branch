TODO: permute-branch

- General:
	- Make sampling permutations faster (Rcpp). This could very well also be a matrix. Moreover, look at what is the slow part of the sampling-code using Rprof(vis)
	- Clean up unused stuff
	X- Merge master branch in here
	- Make the creation of the S and X matrices faster
	- Think about how to do the looping with
	- Implement grouping
	- Create a function which takes the explain object, and a new x_explain input and allows computing the shapley values for that super-fast using the Tmx&Tmu lists.

- LinearGaussian:
	- write the looping over Tmu/Tmx in Rcpp for speed
	- Add MSE computation

- Permute:
	- make finalization part faster
